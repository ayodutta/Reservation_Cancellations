# Reservation_Cancellations

This project is about exploring the factors that influence hotel cancellation rates, a problem affecting revenue and forecasts in a market valued at over $230 Billion. Applied a range of machine learning models to 36,000+ observations to predict cancellations based on a variety of guest and booking attributes. The Random Forest model provides the highest accuracy at 8.87%. Further analysis uncovered key factors that influence cancellation likelihood, such as lead time, average price, length of stay, and medium of booking.
